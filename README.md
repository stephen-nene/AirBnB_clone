# Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
 Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! In this project, you'll embark on a journey to build a web application inspired by the famous AirBnB platform. Before delving into the details, let's familiarize ourselves with the key concepts behind this endeavor. If you haven't already, take a moment to read the [AirBnB concept page](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74).

The primary objective of this initial phase is to construct a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This foundational step lays the groundwork for the subsequent development of a full-fledged web application. Throughout the project, you'll integrate various elements such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API implementation, and front-end integration.


# Files and Directories

```sh
⇒  tree                          
.
├── AUTHORS
├── console.py
├── models
│   ├── base_model.py
│   └── engine
│       └── file_storage.py
├── README.md
└── tests

3 directories, 5 files
```

## Tasks at Hand

To achieve this goal, we'll follow a systematic approach:

1. **BaseModel Class:** Create a parent class, `BaseModel`, responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.

2. **Serialization Flow:** Establish a simple flow for serialization and deserialization, allowing smooth conversion between instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files.

3. **AirBnB Classes:** Develop classes for each key entity in the AirBnB system, such as User, State, City, and Place. These classes will inherit from the `BaseModel`.

4. **Storage Engine:** Implement the first abstracted storage engine for the project – File storage.

5. **Unit Tests:** Create comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.

### What's a Command Interpreter?

Think of the command interpreter as a specialized Shell, limited to managing objects within your AirBnB project. It allows you to:

- Create new objects (e.g., User or Place).
- Retrieve objects from files, databases, etc.
- Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.).
- Update attributes of an object.
- Destroy an object.

By completing these tasks, you'll establish a robust foundation for the subsequent phases of the AirBnB clone project. Let's dive into the details and bring our AirBnB vision to life!
